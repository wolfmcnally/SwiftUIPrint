# SwiftUIPrintDemo

## by Wolf McNally

This is an app to demonstrate [SwiftUIPrint](https://github.com/wolfmcnally/SwiftUIPrint). Look there for documentation.

To use, open `SwiftUIPrintDemo.xcworkspace` and run the project in the simulator or on your device.

If you're testing a lot of print jobs, Apple's Printer Simulator is invaluable. It is available in [Apple Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) as part of the "Additional Tools for Xcode" package.
